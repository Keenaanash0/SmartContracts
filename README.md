# 🧩 SmartContracts Repository

Welcome to the **SmartContracts** repository 🎉  
This repo contains a collection of example **Solidity Smart Contracts** that can be used for learning, experimentation, or as a starting point for your own blockchain projects.

## 🚀 Available Contracts

### 1. Counter Contract
A simple contract to demonstrate the basics of Solidity.  
Features include:
- Initialize a counter with value `0`
- Increment the counter with the `increment` function
- Retrieve the counter value with `getCounter`
- **New**: Retrieve the contract description with `getDescription`

---

### 2. Proposal Contract
A contract that manages proposals with both a title and a description.  
Features include:
- Define a `Proposal` struct with `title` and `description`
- Create a proposal with the `createProposal` function
- Retrieve a proposal’s details (title and description) with `getProposal`

## 🛠 How to Use
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/username/SmartContracts.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the contract you want to try, for example:
   ```bash

   ```
   or
   ```bash
   cd SmartContracts/Solidity/proposal-contract
   ```
3. Open the contract in [Remix IDE](https://remix.ethereum.org/), then compile and deploy it.

## 📌 Roadmap
- Add more example contracts (Voting, ERC20 Token, NFT, etc.)  
- Provide detailed usage instructions for each contract  
- Introduce automated tests using Hardhat or Foundry
